Notes
- palin processes are kicked off by master
- each palin process handles one string and then dies
- the master process enforces upper bound on # of palin processes <= 19
- when master process detects a palin process dies, it reuses its sequential id

Stages of Master
- set up signals
- parse input options
- prepare shared memory
- read strings from file into shm
- kick off a pool of worker processes
    - max out at 19 workers and wait() for a child to terminate
